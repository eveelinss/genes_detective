`cd genes_detective`  
You have gained access to the program `genes_detective` and the folder with modules  
Use the code as a module  
Profit!



## Main Features

`run_dna_rna_tools` returns the transformed dna and rna sequences depending 
on the operation to be performed:  
    - reverse  
    - complement  
    - reverse_complement  
    - transcribe  
    - search_start_codon_in_rna  
    - search_first_codon_in_rna  

`filter_fastq` filtering fastq sequences by GC composition, length, and quality threshold
